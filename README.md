# Project Title : Bank Term Subscription Prediction Project
# Project Overview:
This a classification Project of Bank Term Deposits Subscription of Clients.
Your client is a retail banking institution. Term deposits are a major source
of income for a bank.
### What is Term Deposits?
A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution. Your
money is invested for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed amount of
time, or term.A Term deposit is a deposit that a bank or a financial institurion offers with a fixed rate (often better than just opening deposit account) in which your money will be returned back at a specific maturity time.
### About ::
The bank has various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their
customers such as email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing
and digital marketing.
Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way
to reach out to people. However, they require huge investment as large call
centers are hired to actually execute these campaigns. Hence, it is crucial
to identify the customers most likely to convert beforehand so that they can
be specifically targeted via call.
You are provided with the client data such as : age of the client, their job
type, their marital status, etc. Along with the client data, you are also
provided with the information of the call such as the duration of the call, day
and month of the call, etc. Given this information, your task is to predict if
the client will subscribe to term deposit.
## Data Description
You are provided with following files:
  1. train.csv : Use this dataset to train the model. This file contains all the
  client and call details as well as the target variable “subscribed”. You have
  to train your model using this file.

  2. test.csv : Use the trained model to predict whether a new set of clients
  will subscribe the term deposit.
## Evaluation Metrics :
The Evaluation metric for this competition is accuracy.
##  Model Building and Implementation :
 we will go to model building with the help of different Algorithms namely LOGISTIC REGRESSION,DECISION TREE CLASSIFICATION & K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR ClASSIFIER and implement the best model to predict the test dataset.
Finally We have Implemented Our KNN CLASSIFIER model to predict our Test dataset.After implementing the model,also we have checked our Accuracy with the help of Solution_checker.xlsx file.After printing the predictions,the accuracy is auto-generated & it is found that the model accuracy is close to 91%.
Hence We are going with this model to implement for Prediction of the classification project.
